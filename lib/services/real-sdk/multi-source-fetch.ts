/**
 * Multi-source parallel block fetch (deep-sync speedup, Phase 2).
 *
 * Distributes a large historical block range across SEVERAL daemon nodes so the download runs in
 * parallel instead of one-node-at-a-time, while keeping the FOLD strictly sequential and in block
 * order (the wallet state machine must apply blocks ascending). The premise — that independent
 * healthy nodes return byte-identical data for the same buried range, so concatenating sub-ranges
 * fetched from different nodes equals a single contiguous fetch — was validated against live
 * testnet nodes (zero gaps/dups, identical ordered (height, hash) sequences).
 *
 * This module is PURE and ENGINE-FREE: it is generic over the batch payload `T` and takes the
 * per-node fetch as a callback, so it unit-tests without the network or the SDK, and mock mode
 * never pulls the engine through it.
 *
 * SAFETY (fund-correctness): a node that is BEHIND a requested range would silently return a short
 * result, and with miner-txs off an empty batch is indistinguishable from "no owned txs" — so a
 * behind-node batch could drop blocks undetectably. The driver therefore assigns a batch ONLY to a
 * source whose reported `height` covers the batch's upper bound, and ALWAYS keeps the home node
 * (`sources[0]`) as the failover-of-last-resort. The caller is responsible for bounding the range
 * to the home node's height and keeping the volatile chain TIP on the home node (reorg safety).
