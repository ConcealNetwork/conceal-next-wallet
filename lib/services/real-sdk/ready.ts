/**
 * One-time SDK readiness gate.
 *
 * In the BROWSER build, conceal-lib-js resolves to its browser entry, which loads
 * the crypto/cypher WASM ASYNCHRONOUSLY. Any crypto call before that module is
 * initialized throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
 * '__wbindgen_malloc')`. The SDK exposes `init()` (v0.1.1+) to await that load;
 * it is memoized + idempotent and a no-op in Node (where WASM auto-inits, which is
 * why the unit tests passed without it).
 *
 * {@link ensureSdkReady} MUST be awaited before the FIRST conceal-wallet-sdk crypto
 * call in any code path (createAccount/generateKeys, scanReceiveOutputs, key
 * derivation, ring signatures, …). The pure-JS secretbox/base58 don't strictly
 * need it, but the gate is cheap once warm so every service entry point awaits it.
 *
 * Forward-compatible: written against the v0.1.1 `init` export but resolves it
 * defensively off the module namespace, so it compiles + runs against the
 * currently-installed v0.1.0 (no `init`) too — there it simply no-ops.
