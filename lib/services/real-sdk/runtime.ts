/**
 * Per-wallet runtime cache for the SDK wallet engine — the SDK analogue of the
 * legacy `window.__ccxRuntimeWallet`, extended for SMOOTH multi-wallet switching.
 *
 * Instead of a single unlocked wallet, the engine keeps a `Map` of unlocked
 * {@link SdkRuntime}s keyed by wallet id, plus the id of the currently `active`
 * one. Switching to an ALREADY-UNLOCKED wallet is then instant — no re-open, no
 * password — while switching to one that isn't cached unlocks it in place. Each
 * runtime holds the wallet's account (keys + address), the persisted
 * {@link RawWalletV1} blob, the live SDK {@link WalletState}, the daemon client,
 * the password, AND its OWN sync/persist coordination state.
 *
 * CONCURRENCY INVARIANT (CRITICAL)
 * --------------------------------
 * A `sync()` or `persist()` is bound to ONE specific runtime when it starts and
 * only ever reads/writes THAT runtime's state + storage. If the user switches the
 * active wallet from A to B while A's sync is mid-flight, A's scan still folds into
 * A's cached runtime and persists into A's keyspace — it NEVER writes A's data into
 * B's storage (or vice-versa). To guarantee this, `syncOnce`/`runSyncChain`/
 * `persistNow` take the owning runtime as an argument and the sync-coalescing state
 * (`inFlightSync`, `pendingSync`, `persistChain`) lives PER runtime, not as module
 * globals.
 *
 * SECURITY
 * --------
 * `lock()` / `disconnect()` (and the idle auto-lock that calls `disconnect()`) drop
 * the ENTIRE map, so no decrypted wallet keys for ANY cached wallet survive a lock.
 *
 * STATE + PERSISTENCE MODEL
 * -------------------------
 * Everything lives inside the ONE encrypted `"wallet"` blob per keyspace (so a single
 * `saveStoredWallet` round-trips keys, settings, contacts, sent messages AND the
 * synced state). The live SDK {@link WalletState} is serialized into a custom
 * `raw.sdkWalletState` field (carried by `RawWalletV1`'s index signature) on every
 * persist. On unlock:
 *
 *   - An EXISTING legacy blob (written by `wallet-core`) has NO `sdkWalletState`,
 *     so we build a fresh {@link WalletState} seeded at `creationHeight` — the
 *     wallet then re-syncs all of its history from the daemon, but never rescans
 *     blocks before it existed. After the first sync we write `sdkWalletState`
 *     back, so subsequent unlocks resume from the saved `scannedHeight`.
 *   - A blob previously saved by THIS engine carries `sdkWalletState` and is
 *     `deserializeWalletState`-d, resuming exactly where it left off.
 *
 * INBOUND MESSAGES: the SDK `WalletState` discards tx `extra`, so during each sync
 * scan we also reconstruct received messages (`readMessageFromTransaction`) and
 * persist them into `raw.receivedMessages` (deduped by tx hash) — so a full re-sync
 * of an existing legacy wallet rebuilds its inbound message history too.
 *
 * No `lib/wallet-core` import anywhere here — the whole point of the engine.
