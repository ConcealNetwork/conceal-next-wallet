/**
 * Worker pool for the per-tx scan (deep-sync fold parallelism, Phase 3). {@link scanBatch} splits a
 * batch's raw txs into contiguous chunks, scans them across a pool of {@link Worker}s IN PARALLEL,
 * and reassembles the results IN ORDER. Because {@link scanRawTransaction} is deterministic (same
 * WASM, same inputs), a worker result is byte-identical to an in-thread one — the pool only
 * distributes + reorders, it never changes what a scan produces.
 *
 * PROFILE-DRIVEN: the pool size is the `workers` count from the active wallet's "Sync speed" profile
 * (see lib/ui/sync-speed.ts) — `scanBatch(…, workers)`. The default ("Hurt me plenty") requests a
 * real pool so the ECDH fold stays OFF the main thread (legacy wallet-core always did this via
 * `ParseWorker`s; an in-thread tight loop freezes the UI on phones). `workers === 0` ("I'm too young
 * to die") scans in-thread but YIELDS every {@link YIELD_EVERY} txs so React can still paint. The
 * Turbopack worker chunk encodes its bootstrap config in the URL HASH (`turbopack-worker-<hash>.js
 * #params=…`); a hash never reaches the network, so a PWA service worker that cache-first-served the
 * bare chunk made the module worker's `self.location` lose the params → "Missing worker bootstrap
 * config". The service worker now keeps worker chunks OFF its cache so they load from the network with
 * the hash intact (`isWorkerChunk` in lib/pwa/precache.mjs + public/service-worker.js), so the pool
 * boots correctly. Multi-source FETCH parallelism (also profile-scaled via `maxSources`) is
 * independent of this pool.
 *
 * SAFETY: every failure mode falls back to the cooperative in-thread scan (no pool / no Worker
 * support / a worker error / a timeout), so the worker path can never break or stall sync — worst
 * case it is the single-threaded fold WITH event-loop yields (UI stays responsive, just slower). A
 * worker that errors on LOAD never replies, so we wire its `error`/`messageerror` events to tear the
 * pool down and settle every in-flight chunk in-thread IMMEDIATELY rather than waiting out
 * {@link CHUNK_TIMEOUT_MS} per batch. The caller must have run `ensureSdkReady` (the in-thread
 * fallback uses the main-thread WASM).
 *
 * The pool is a process-wide singleton. Concurrent `scanBatch` calls (e.g. the active wallet's sync
 * and a background secondary-wallet sync, #108) share it: requests are id-keyed and the per-tx scan
 * is pure, so results stay correct, but the workers are time-sliced rather than truly parallel
 * across both — a perf trade-off, never a correctness issue.
