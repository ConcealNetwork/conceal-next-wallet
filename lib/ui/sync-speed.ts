/**
 * Wallet sync intensity — the "Sync speed" setting, themed after the DOOM skill levels. It maps to a
 * concrete {@link SyncProfile} that drives the real deep-sync engine knobs: the Web Worker scan-pool
 * size, the per-batch block count, and how many pool nodes a multi-source catch-up fans across.
 * Higher = faster, but more CPU + network. "Nightmare!" holds nothing back (all cores, biggest
 * batch, most nodes) and will make the UI sweat — that's the point.
 *
 * Pure + engine-free (imported by BOTH the settings UI and the SDK runtime), so it never pulls the
 * engine into mock mode. The persisted value stays the `options.readSpeed` NUMBER so existing wallets
 * keep loading; each level owns a stable readSpeed id. These ids are DELIBERATELY disjoint from the
 * legacy v1 values (2/10/50/100) — under the old engine `readSpeed` was a dead no-op, so a wallet
 * that happens to carry one of those resets to the default level rather than silently jumping to an
 * aggressive worker pool it never knowingly chose (GLM review).
